`Videos/ENV` contain the top 5 and worst 5 recorded episodes of agents blinded w.r.t. the observable with the lowest feature importance and lowest performance (footnote 4)

`Videos/Swimmer-v4_theta_tip` contains the top 5 and worst 5 recorded episodes of TD3 agents for Swimmer-v4 blinded w.r.t. $\theta_{tip}$ (footnote 5)
